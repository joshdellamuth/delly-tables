# Scratch Paper
## Idea for the project 
Flowchartting a diagramming software with clean navigation to drill down into different sections of charts, tables, views, and cells. 

## Possible stacks or tools to use
Will put a checkmark next to each of the ones I choose to use and put reasoning next to it

 - [ ] IDE: Visual Studio
 - [ ] IDE: Visual Studio Code
 - [ ] Repository: GitHub
 - [ ] Pipelines: GitHub Actions
 - [ ] Backend language: C#
 - [ ] Front end: Blazor Web Assembly w/ html canvas element
 - [ ] Front end: HTML, CSS, JQuery and TypeScript 
 - [ ] Database: Local database only? 
 - [ ] Database: Have to connect some sort of storage in order to use? (similar to Draw.io)
 - [ ] Database: NoSQL database like CosmosDB
 - [ ] Documentation: Markup on GitHub
 - [ ] Markup writer: [StackedIt.io](https://stackedit.io/app#)
 - [ ] App flowchartting (until app is created): [Delly Tables Planning: Lucidspark](https://lucid.app/lucidspark/d1392827-ef4f-4fa7-8919-f12fd21dcc31/edit?beaconFlowId=115803D20B2B2086&page=0_0&invitationId=inv_beeff40a-6a0e-448e-a4a1-6c4dfd772d1c#)
 - [ ] Ability to integrate reminders and share lists of reminders
 - [ ] Ability to share baords with others
 - [ ] Color customization
 - [ ] Different views based on the objects in the tables
 - [ ] Search functionality to pull specific objects from the view
 - [ ] Automatically assign IDs to objects for user to see
 - [ ] Ability to export the flowchart as json to be version controlled (the json would have to include shape position, object properties, and object instances on the canvas)
